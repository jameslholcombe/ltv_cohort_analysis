# ltv_cohort_analysis
This program uses the `pandas` library to calculate the weighted average value of a customer lifetime. The program takes a raw transaction history in Excel (`.xlsx`) and returns an Excel file with tabs:
- Complete customer transaction history
- Cohort size
- Weighted average customer value
- Aggregated cohort value

## Preparing the data

Before running the program, save an Excel file that has columns, in this order: `transaction_id`, `customer_id`, `transaction_date`, `value`. The `value` column can be any potential aggregated value. Common use cases would be: a dollar amount (eg. gross revenue, gross margin), a count (eg. number of items bought so the integer 1, 2, 5, etc), an integer of time value (eg. seconds, minutes, hours).
Name the tab the data is in `raw_data`.

The names of the columns don't matter, but you **DO** need headers, and the columns should be in the correct order.

## To run the program:
1. Install `virtualenv` on your system:
  - On OSX or Linux, this will probably work: `$ sudo pip install virtualenv`
  - On Ubuntu Linux, this will probably work: `$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv`
2. Create a new directory 
  - `$cd new_directory`
  - `$virtualenv venv`
3. Activate the corresponding virtual environment
-`$ . venv/bin/activate`
4. Install `pandas`
- `pip install pandas`
